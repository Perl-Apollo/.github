# Apollo

This organization was originally named "Oshun," but people were understandably confusing this organization with the [`oshun`](https://github.com/Perl-Oshun/oshun) project. Renaming this to Apollo fixes that problem.

The name "Apollo" is not referencing the god. It's referencing NASA's Apollo program, following Gemini, to get to the moon. It was ambituous, and it worked. Specially, it references Apollo 13, the film version. For everything that went wrong, it was a success. For inspiration, we look to the [filter scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3csfLkMJT4&ab_channel=BenjaminRaghe) where the engineers at NASA had to scramble to create a working CO2 filter out of the parts on the spacecraft. There was no "start from scratch" luxury. That's the spirit of this project.

This is a GitHub organization for people interested in the [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) programming language.
