# Apollo

This organization was originally named "Oshun," but people were confusing the Oshun organization with the Oshun project. Renaming this fixes that problem.

The name "Apollo" is not referencing the god. It's referencing the Apollo program, following Gemini, to get to the moon. It was ambituous, and it worked. Specially, it referemces Apollo 13, the film version. For everything that went wrong, it was a success. For inspiration, we look to the [filter scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3csfLkMJT4&ab_channel=BenjaminRagheb) where the engineers at NASA had to scramble to create a working CO2 filter out of the parts on the spacecraft. There was no "start from scratch" luxury. That's the spirit of this project.

This is a GitHub organization for people interested in the [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) programming language.

Visit our [`oshun`](https://github.com/Perl-Oshun/oshun) repository where you can participate in discussions about the "type" system for Perl.
